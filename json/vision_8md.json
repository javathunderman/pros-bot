This is done through the V5\nVision Utility program.\n\n## Retrieving Objects\n\nThe primary function of the vision sensor is returning objects, or blobs\nof color detected by the sensor. The characteristics of an object are\ndefined in\n[vision_object_s_t](../../api/c/vision.html#vision_object_s_t).\n\n### By Size\n\nThe simplest way to interact with the vision sensor is to get an object\nby its size. 0 is the largest object detected by the sensor.\n\n### By Signature\n\nIf you have multiple signatures saved to the vision signature, you will\nmost likely want to only look for objects of a particular signature. The\n`get_by_sig()` function implements this functionality.\n\n## Changing the Object Coordinates\n\nEach returned object from the vision sensor comes with a set of\ncoordinates telling where the object was found in the vision sensor's\nfield of view. The default behavior is to return the coordinates as a\nfunction of distance from the top left corner of the field of view - so\npositive y is downward and positive x is right. With the PROS API, you\ncan change this behavior so that the center of the Field Of View is the\n(0,0) point for object coordinates. Positive y is still downward and\npositive x is still right, but negative y is upward of center and\nnegative x is left of center in this configuration.\n\n## Exposure Setting\n\nIn PROS Kernel 3.1.4 and earlier, the vision sensor exposure parameter\nwas in the range [0,58]. In PROS Kernel 3.1.5 and newer, the parameter\nis scaled to be in the range [0,150] to match the Vision Sensor utility.\nAs a result, there is a loss of information in this translation since\nmultiple integers on the scale [0,150] map to the scale [0,58].",
