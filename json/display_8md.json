LVGL is a full-featured C\ngraphics library (it's accessible in C++ projects too under the same\nAPI).\n\nThe first step to getting started with LVGL is to include `pros/apix.h`\nin your `main.h` file or other header files. This includes the full LVGL\nfeature set as described in their documentation:\n<https://littlevgl.com/>\n\nYou can follow along with any of the LVGL\n[tutorials](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_examples/tree/master/lv_tutorial)\nor [wiki](https://docs.littlevgl.com/#Objects). There is no need to port\nor initialize LVGL, you can simply start creating objects.\n\n\\note\nCustom LVGL code cannot be displayed at the same time as the [LLEMU](./llemu.html).\nAs a result, you must remove the LLEMU code (`pros::lcd`) that is\npresent in `main.cpp` by default in a new project.",
