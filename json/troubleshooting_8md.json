If you also have\nthe V5 Utility open, that would cause this error to occur. Close the V5\nUtility if you want to flash.\n\n## Compile-Time Issues\n\n> - `\"main.h\" file not found`:\n>   : This error occurs when the compilation database\n>   `compile_commands.json` is not up to date. The file contains\n>   the exact compiler calls of the project, and should be\n>   automatically populated when the code is compiled. If you see\n>   this error just after creating a project, it could be because\n>   the project was created using the CLI without the\n>   after creating the project. Regardless of when this issue\n>   after creating the project. Regardless of when this issue\n>   appears, running `pros make all` in the CLI or running\n>   `PROS -> Build -> All` in the editor, the whole project is\n>   compiled again, fixing this issue. You may need to close and\n>   reopen any files in order for the linter to catch up. It is\n>   also possible that a compilation error was not caught by the\n>   linter, so running a full build will help discover these\n>   hidden errors.\n\n> - `undefined reference to ...` or `implicit declaration of function ...`:\n>   : A function name is spelled incorrectly, or the function was\n>   incorrectly declared in a header file. Custom headers must be\n>   included in `main.h` or in the file in which they are used.\n>\n> - `format ... expects argument of type ..., but argument has type ...`:\n>   : The value provided to a function like\n>   [printf](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) or\n>   [lcd_print](../../api/c/llemu.html#lcd-print) does not match\n>   the expected type inferred from the format string. Some\n>   instances of this warning can be safely ignored, but crashes\n>   can occur if types `double` or `long long` are mixed with\n>   other types.\n>\n> - `assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast`:\n>   : Typically caused when a C pointer has the wrong number of\n>   asterisks to\n>   [dereference](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4955297/3681958) it,\n>   or when assigning a constant to `pointer` (instead of\n>   `*pointer`).\n\n## Run-Time Issues\n\n> - **Some tasks are running, others are not:**\n>   : A task is not waiting using\n>   [delay](../../api/c/rtos.html#delay) or\n>   [task_delay_until](../../api/c/rtos.html#task-delay-until).\n>   Due to the fact that PROS utilizes a priority based\n>   non-preemptive scheduler, tasks of higher or equal priority to\n>   the blocking task will still run while lower priority tasks\n>   will not. This scenario is also known as\n>   [starvation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)>).\n>   See [Tasks/Multithreading](/tutorials/topical/multitasking)\n>   for more information.\n>\n> - **VEX LCD updates very slowly or is \"frozen\":**\n>   : A task is not waiting using\n>   [delay](../../api/c/rtos.html#delay) or\n>   From the kernel's perspective, updating the LCD is usually\n>   less important than how well the robot is running, so PROS\n>   prioritizes user tasks over the LCD.\n>\n>       The LCD is only updated if all other tasks are waiting.\n>\n> - **Neither autonomous nor driver control code starts:**\n>   : The `initialize()` function may still be running. Some tasks\n>   such as\n>   [analog_calibrate](../../api/c/adi.html#analog-calibrate)\n>   take time.\n>\n>       If the `initialize()` function implements some type of loop or\n>       autonomous selection routine, verify that it actually has a\n>       means of ending.\n>\n> - **Code restarts unexpectedly:**\n>   : A run-time error has caused the program to crash.\n>   @ref debugging may reveal the cause of the error.\n>   Examine any newly added code for possible logical errors. Some\n>   common error messages include:\n>\n>   \\* **Segmentation Fault:**\n>   : Indicates that an invalid C pointer has been used. Check for\n>   confusion between pointers and regular variables and that an\n>   invalid pointer has not been passed to a PROS API function.\n>\n>   \\* **Stack Overflow:**\n>   : Often indicates infinite recursion, or that the stack size for\n>   a custom task is too small. Calling many layers of functions\n>   and declaring large local variables can require large amounts\n>   of space on the stack. If this error occurs in a default task\n>   like `autonomous()`, consider changing code to reduce the\n>   stack requirements, or creating a new task with a larger stack\n>   size using [task_create](../../api/c/rtos.html#task_create)\n>   to handle large jobs. Large arrays declared inside functions\n>   can usually be declared globally to alleviate pressure on\n>   stack space.\n>\n>   \\* **System Task Failure:**\n>   : Too many tasks were running for the system to start a new one.\n>   Disable or merge unnecessary tasks to eliminate this error.\n>\n> - **Cortex blinking red light after upload:**\n>   : Turn the Cortex microcontroller off and on again. This usually\n>   resolves the problem, and it is generally good practice to\n>   re-initialize the robot to simulate conditions at most\n>   competitions. If the error persists, see the \"**Code restarts\n>   unexpectedly**\" section above.\n>\n> - [printf](printf_) **doesn't work**:\n> - [printf](printf_) **doesn't work**:\n>   : [printf](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/)\n>   prints information over a serial connection\n>   @ref debugging, not to the VEX\n>   LCD. To print to the LCD, use\n>   [lcd_print](../../api/c/llemu.html#lcd-print) instead.",
