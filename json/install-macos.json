  "details": "There are currently two ways to install PROS 3 on macOS. The recommended method uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and the other method involves installing components manually.\n\n\n## Recommended Method (Homebrew)\n\nThe recommended method of installing PROS 3 for macOS involves using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).\n\n\n\n1. If you do not already have Homebrew installed, install it by following the instructions on [their site](https://brew.sh). This will take a while, and may prompt you to follow some additional instructions.\n2. Once you have Homebrew installed, run `brew tap osx-cross/arm && brew install arm-gcc-bin` to register a repository with Homebrew that contains the toolchain used to build PROS projects, and then install the toolchain.\n3. Run `brew tap purduesigbots/pros` to register the PROS Homebrew repository with Homebrew.\n4. Run `brew cask install pros-editor` to install the PROS Editor (the CLI will also be installed). This may also take a while.\n5. That's it! You can now start using PROS 3.\nIf you do not want to use the PROS Editor, and instead intend to use only the PROS CLI, substitute the command in step 3 with the following: `brew install pros-cli`.\n\n\n## Other Methods\n\nIf you don't want to use Homebrew to install PROS 3, you can install all the components manually.\n\n\n### Install the toolchain\n\n\n\n1. Download the latest version of the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for macOS from [their site](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).\n2. Once you have downloaded the toolchain, double click the file to extract its contents.\n3. Copy the contents of the `gcc-arm-none-eabi-X-20XX-qX-update` folder (where the Xs are numbers specific to the version you downloaded) to another folder, for example `/usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain`.\n4. Now you will need to link the toolchain binaries to somewhere that the system will be able to find them. There are two ways to do this:\n    * recommended, easy to update: run `mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/pros-toolchain && ln -s /usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain/bin/* /usr/local/bin/pros-toolchain` replacing `/usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain` with the path to the folder you made in step 4 above. Finally, add `/usr/local/bin/pros-toolchain` to the end of your `/etc/paths` file.\n    * easier, less easy to update: simply run `ln -s /usr/local/lib/pros-toolchain/bin/* /usr/local/bin`.\n\n### Install the CLI\n\n\n\n1. Install Python 3.6 or higher from [the Python website](http://python.org).\n2. Install the CLI by downloading the latest version of the Python Wheel file (.whl) from [here](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli3/releases/latest). Once downloaded, run `python3 -m pip install ~/Downloads/pros-cli-v5_3.X.X-py3-none-any.whl` (replacing that path with the path to which you downloaded the file).\n\n### Install the Editor\n\nThis section is optional if you intend to use an editor other than the PROS Editor\n\n\n\n1. Build and install cquery by following the instructions on [their wiki page](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Building-cquery).\n2. Download the pros-editor-mac.zip file from [our releases page](https://github.com/purduesigbots/atom/releases/latest). Once downloaded, double click to extract the application, then drag the `PROS Editor.app` file to your `/Applications` folder.\n\n## Requirements\n\nMinimum macOS version: 10.8 Minimum Python version: 3.6\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\n`RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment.`\n\nIf you are using the PROS Editor, open up your init script (File > Init Script) and add the following two lines:\n\n\n\n```cpp\nprocess.env.LANG = 'en_US.utf-8'\nprocess.env.LC_ALL = 'en_US.utf-8'\n```\n\n_Filename: .coffee_\n\nIf you are just using the CLI at the Terminal:\n\n\n\n* Open up your Terminal.\n* Run `cd` to make sure you're in your home directory.\n* Run `touch .bash_profile` to make sure you have a shell login configuration file.\n* Edit the `~/.bash_profile` file in your preferred editor (you can also run `open -e .bash_profile` to edit it in TextEdit), adding the following two lines at the end:\n\n\n```cpp\nexport LANG=\"en_US.utf-8\"\nexport LC_ALL=\"en_US.utf-8\"\n```\n\n_Filename: .bash_\n\n\n\n* Run `. .bash_profile` to reload the file for the current session.\n\n\n------------------\n\n`/bin/sh: intercept-c++: command not found`\n\nThis issue should be fixed for PROS CLI versions > 3.1.2\n\n\n\n1. Check your PROS CLI version by running `prosv5 --version`. If your version is <= 3.1.2, try updating first to check if that solves your problem. If not, continue with step 2.\n2. Follow steps 1-4 listed above for those using the CLI only. In step 4, however, add the following line instead (replacing the Xs with the numbers found in step 1):\n\n\n```cpp\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/Cellar/pros-cli/3.X.X/libexec/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\n_Filename: .bash_",
