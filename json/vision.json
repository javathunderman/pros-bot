This is done through the V5 Vision Utility program.\n\n\n## Retrieving Objects\n\nThe primary function of the vision sensor is returning objects, or blobs of color detected by the sensor. The characteristics of an object are defined in [vision_object_s_t](../../api/c/vision.html#vision_object_s_t).\n\n\n### By Size\n\nThe simplest way to interact with the vision sensor is to get an object by its size. 0 is the largest object detected by the sensor.\n\n\n### By Signature\n\nIf you have multiple signatures saved to the vision signature, you will most likely want to only look for objects of a particular signature. The `get_by_sig()` function implements this functionality.\n\n\n## Changing the Object Coordinates\n\nEach returned object from the vision sensor comes with a set of coordinates telling where the object was found in the vision sensor's field of view. The default behavior is to return the coordinates as a function of distance from the top left corner of the field of view - so positive y is downward and positive x is right. With the PROS API, you can change this behavior so that the center of the Field Of View is the (0,0) point for object coordinates. Positive y is still downward and positive x is still right, but negative y is upward of center and negative x is left of center in this configuration.\n\n\n## Exposure Setting\n\nIn PROS Kernel 3.1.4 and earlier, the vision sensor exposure parameter was in the range [0,58]. In PROS Kernel 3.1.5 and newer, the parameter is scaled to be in the range [0,150] to match the Vision Sensor utility. As a result, there is a loss of information in this translation since multiple integers on the scale [0,150] map to the scale [0,58]. ",
