Each task has a 32-bit notification\nvalue. Each task can block on its own notification (wait for it to\nbecome non-zero) and any task can update the notification value. Task\nnotifications have a broad range of applications, are simple to use, and\nhave significant memory and speed advantages when compared to\ntraditional semaphore-based synchronization mechanisms.\n\nThe simplest application of task notifications does not care about the\ntask notification value:",
